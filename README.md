# SeniorResearch
My senior research project based on public key encryption written in python
This is a project where I did a lot of research on public key encryptions and then tried to write my own
To prove I actually knew something about the subject, I didn't look at previous public key encryption code and wrote it all myself
I did this on a linux OS and wrote in python. I wrote it so that when you open up the command line interface on the linux computer
you would type in a word (I used the word "encryption") once in the directory with the file that went through a set of pre-made commands, 
ending up opening the file and showing the user what to type in when asked for the directory. It sent the files over FTP, and I attempted
to make it so that people could more easily navigate it on the command line interface after it was all set up, in case they weren't 
computer savvy. 
I am really, REALLY new at this and would really appreciate any feedback on the efficiency of the code, and I am going to try to upload
an encrypted file to see if anyone wants to try to break it. 
I am also new at github, so please forgive me if this isn't posted where it needs to be and help me out 
THANKS!!
